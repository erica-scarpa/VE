# MEE 4, 115 +

The main fragment of this tablet, TM.75.G.2422, was initially published by Pettinato in 1982 as MEE 4 115. In MEE 15, Picchioni identified an additional four fragments that join with this tablet (listed below). Picchioni also proposed a potential fifth connection with another fragment (TM.75.G.11302). An image of the tablet's obverse was included in the exhibition catalogue *Ebla origini* (1995) appearing on page 365 as catalog number 154. As of now, the remaining joins have not been published.
