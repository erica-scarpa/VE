# Manuscript A-1

Manuscript A-1/EBL<sub>2</sub> (Pettinato A1, A4-6, A7, G, H, I) comprises a total of 1090 entries, spanning from the initial entry to [[VE 1089]]. The only consolidated edition available is documented in the DCCLT under the identifier P241570. This edition is referenced within the current overview. Notably, this tablet serves as the "first page" of a manuscript that, according to Archi's reconstruction, extended across two tablets, with the subsequent one being [[Manuscript A-2]].

The terminology used to distinguish these manuscripts hinges upon the assumption that Manuscript A-2 (equivalent to Pettinato’s AZ = MEE 4 63+64 + BG = MEE 4 71 + A III 683; also referred to by Bonechi as EBL<sub>3b</sub>) continues the content initiated in Manuscript A-1. However, Bonechi proposes an alternative perspective, suggesting that Manuscript A-2 is the direct continuation of [[Manuscript C]] (referred to by Bonechi as EBL<sub>3a</sub>; see [[Bonechi, 'Putative Source' (2016)]]). It's important to observe that both [[Manuscript A-2]]/EBL<sub>3b</sub> and [[Manuscript A-1]]/EBL<sub>2</sub> incorporate glossenkeilen, while such annotations are absent in [[Manuscript C]]/EBL<sub>3a</sub>. Manuscript A-1 includes fragments:
* [[A1]], *MEE* 4, 1
* [[A4-6]], *MEE* 4, 4+5+6
* [[A7]], *MEE* 4, 7
* [[G]], *MEE* 4, 16
* [[H]], *MEE* 4, 17
* [[I]], *MEE* 4, 18
