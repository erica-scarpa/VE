# Manuscript A-1

Manuscript A-1/EBL<sub>2</sub> (Pettinato A1, A4-6, A7, G, H, I) comprises a total of 1090 entries, spanning from the initial entry to [[VE 1089]]. The only consolidated edition available is documented in the DCCLT under the identifier P241570. Notably, this tablet serves as the "first page" of a manuscript that, according to Archi's reconstruction, extended across two tablets, with the subsequent one being [[Manuscript A-2]]. The manuscript was published on the DCCLT as P241570. A picture of the joined fragments was published in [[Matthiae et al., Ebla origini (1995)]], cat. no. 154, pp.351 and 365.

The terminology used to distinguish these manuscripts hinges upon the assumption that Manuscript A-2 (equivalent to Pettinatoâ€™s AZ = MEE 4 63+64 + BG = MEE 4 71 + A III 683; also referred to by Bonechi as EBL<sub>3b</sub>) continues the content initiated in Manuscript A-1. However, Bonechi proposes an alternative perspective, suggesting that Manuscript A-2 is the direct continuation of [[Manuscript C]] (referred to by Bonechi as EBL<sub>3a</sub>; see [[Bonechi, 'Putative Source' (2016)]]). It's important to observe that both [[Manuscript A-2]]/EBL<sub>3b</sub> and [[Manuscript A-1]]/EBL<sub>2</sub> incorporate glossenkeilen, while such annotations are absent in [[Manuscript C]]/EBL<sub>3a</sub>. Manuscript A-1 includes fragments:
* [[A1]], *MEE* 4, 1
* [[A4-6]], *MEE* 4, 4+5+6
* [[A7]], *MEE* 4, 7
* [[G]], *MEE* 4, 16
* [[H]], *MEE* 4, 17
* [[I]], *MEE* 4, 18
