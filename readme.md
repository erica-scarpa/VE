The *Vocabolario di Ebla* (VE) is an umbrella term used to identify a group of lexical compositions described as bilingual lists or glossaries. These documents, compiled by the scribes of the ancient city of [Ebla](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/869702586) around 2370 BCE, include hundreds of Sumerian words and expressions, with some of these also featuring translations or paraphrases in Eblaite. Scholars have identified at least four different manuscripts or "versions" of this glossary, and they have been engaged in reconstructing them from dozens of fragments over the past fifty years. Several dozens of shorter excerpts (called *estratti*) have also been discovered

The *Vocabolario* serves as an indispensable tool for linguists, historians, and archaeologists who are dedicated to studying the Eblaite language and the ancient city itself. It plays a crucial role in enabling researchers to decode the meanings of Eblaite words, comprehend the grammatical structure of the language, and acquire insights into the vocabulary used by the accountants who worked in the Palace.

## Structure of the Composition

The various manuscripts and excerpts collectively exhibit a consistent structure, albeit with some variations. The Sumerian words are arranged following an acrographic order (*i.e.* by sign shape) and  most bilingual lists are divided into sections that gather words commencing with the same logogram. For instance, in [[Manuscript A-1]], the list commences with [[Section NINDA]] (𒃻), followed by [[Section KA]] (𒅗), [[Section SAG]] (𒊕), and so forth. Each of these sections encompasses numerous words that start with the corresponding logogram.

Certain words are accompanied by a [gloss](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gloss#dictionary-entry-3) in Eblaite. These glosses occasionally serve as direct translations, although paraphrases also appear. In some bilingual compositions, a *glossenkeil* (a small 𒀹, here marked as ✽) is introduced. This sign conventionally denotes Semitic translations, allowing for a clear differentiation from Sumerian entries. A glossed entry looks as follows:

|          |                               |        |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------ |
| rev.VI:4 | gi<sub>6</sub>-sa<sub>2</sub> | 𒈪𒁲   |
| rev.VI:5 | *ba-na me-*                   | 𒁀𒈾𒈨 |
|          | *-si-im*                      | 𒋛𒅎   |

This entry appears in [[Manuscript D5]], fifth column, fouth and fifth cases. The Sumerian term gi<sub>6</sub>-sa<sub>2</sub> is equated with the expression /bayna(y) mīšim/, "in the middle of the night".

## Variants and Composite Text

As previously mentioned, multiple manuscripts and abridged versions of this lexical composition exist. The list of Sumerian terms remains relatively consistent across most of these texts, as most are based on the acrographic manuscripts. These are monolingual lists of Sumerian words which served as an outline for the bilingual compositions. However, the presence of glosses for a given term can vary between different bilingual manuscripts. Furthermore, even when present in multiple manuscripts, the glosses themselves might exhibit significant discrepancies. For instance, consider again the term gi<sub>6</sub>-sa<sub>2</sub>. In [[Manuscript A-2]] and [[Manuscript B]], the respective glosses differ from the one found in [[Manuscript D]]. Specifically, [[Manuscript A-2]] and [[Manuscript B]] translate it as /šiqrum/, "dawn" (spelled *si-gi-lu-um* and *si-gi-lum* respectively), while [[Manuscript C]] presents *u*<sub>3</sub>-*ru* *mu-si-im*, signifying /[urru](https://www.ebl.lmu.de/dictionary/urru%20I) [mūšim](https://www.ebl.lmu.de/dictionary/m%C5%AB%C5%A1u%20I)/ ("light of the night").

A composite text encompasses all the variations of a Sumerian term and available glosses. The composite text for the *Vocabolario di Ebla* currently available was published by Giovanni Pettinato in 1982 (*MEE* 4). In his edition, all Sumerian terms and their corresponding glosses, if provided, have been systematically numbered and consolidated into a single comprehensive synopsis. The (updated) entry for gi<sub>6</sub>-sa<sub>2</sub> is presented as follows:

|        |     |                                                                 |                  |
| ------ | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| VE 817 | A-1 | gi<sub>6</sub>-sa<sub>2</sub> / *si-gi-lu-um* ✽                 | 𒈪𒁲 / 𒋛𒄀𒇻𒌝 𒀹   |
|        | B   | gi<sub>6</sub>-sa<sub>2</sub> / *si-gi-lum*                     | 𒈪𒁲 / 𒋛𒄀𒈝      |
|        | C   | gi<sub>6</sub>-sa<sub>2</sub> / *u*<sub>3</sub>-*ru* *mu-si-im* | 𒈪𒁲 / 𒅇𒂗𒈬𒋛𒅎  |
|        | D   | gi<sub>6</sub>-sa<sub>2</sub> / *ba-na me-si-im*                | 𒈪𒁲 / 𒁀𒈾 𒈨𒋛𒅎 |

## Present Synopsis

This website aims to provide a dynamic and up-to-date synopsis of the most extensively studied entries from the *Vocabolario di Ebla*. Leveraging the [Wikilink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Link) feature, commonly employed in wiki environments like Wikipedia, this platform facilitates the creation of an interconnected web of pages. These pages utilize double square brackets, as in ``[[this]]``, to frame essential keywords. The integration of hyperlinks is automated through the [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) software, enabling the compilation and publication of static webpages via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Beyond technical considerations, this website serves as a comprehensive repository of records, establishing hierarchical connections among all facets of the *Vocabolario di Ebla*. This system encompasses various elements, ranging from fragments and sources to entries and manuscripts, all interlinked within a unified framework.

The navigation menu is straightforward and self-explanatory. To begin your exploration of the *Vocabolario*, you can choose to browse through the [manuscripts](https://erica-scarpa.github.io/VE/Bilingual%20Manuscripts.html), [sources](https://erica-scarpa.github.io/VE/Bilingual.html), or the [glosses](https://erica-scarpa.github.io/VE/Synopsis.html). For a visual representation of the included VE entries, you can refer to the visualization accessible [here](https://erica-scarpa.github.io/VE/Chart.html).

As previously mentioned, since the bilingual compositions are primarily based on acrographic monolingual manuscripts, it's important to consider these [manuscripts](https://erica-scarpa.github.io/VE/Acrographic%20Manuscripts.html) along with their corresponding [sources](https://erica-scarpa.github.io/VE/Acrographic.html). Additionally, we also take into account other [monolingual Sumerian compositions](https://erica-scarpa.github.io/VE/Monolingual.html) of Mesopotamian origin, albeit to a lesser extent.
