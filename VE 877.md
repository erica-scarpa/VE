¶ 'One that is always jumping'; maybe a loan from Sum. gud₂, gu₄-ud, 'to jump', see Civil, 'Bilingualism' (1984), 92. Note that MEE 4 assigns the term to the bilingual excerpt u (MEE 4, 95), but it is attested in MEE 4, 96 (TM.75.G.10018) labelled by Pettinato as excerpt v. In addition, the text can be classified as a bilingual list of animals, rather than an excerpt of the VE. The entry should thus be removed as it does not present any direct connection to any manuscript of the VE.
