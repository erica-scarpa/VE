# MEE 4, 63 + MEE 4, 64 = TM.75.G.10023 + TM.75.G.11301

The source AZ was published for the first time by Pettinato in MEE 4 (1982) and belongs to [[Manuscript A-2]]/EBL<sub>3b</sub>. This source is the result of a join between two fragments TM.75.G.10023 and TM.75.G.11301, and was published by Pettinato as such, although it received a unique label as a source of the VE (AZ). For other joins of this fragments, see sub [[Manuscript A-2]]. A revised edition is available on the DCCLT. Note, however, thet the latter thoroughly omits the *glossenkeilen*, which are instead marked in Pettinato's edition. No picture of the fragments is currently available
